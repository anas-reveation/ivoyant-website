                  Artificial intelligence (AI) allows machines to learn directly
                  from their experiences and problem-solve. Combine this with
                  the rapid rise of robotics in the workplace, and both the
                  business world and society in general are potentially facing
                  problems. In a recent series of interviews conducted in the UK
                  by the The Royal Society – the venerable body for the
                  promotion of science – people shared their worries about
                  depersonalisation; the fear that machines with artificial
                  intelligence (AI) will replace human one-to-one experience.
                  This is of greatest concern in the care-giving services due to
                  the personalisation and empathy desired. Despite these
                  concerns, UK researchers from Middlesex University and the
                  University of Bedfordshire are seeing the rise of robotics as
                  the future of healthcare, as they assist in the development of
                  ‘pepper robots’, a humanoid robot unveiled three years ago
                  with the ability to read emotions. Robotics and AI in the
                  healthcare industry can already been seen in action, in the
                  way of medical apps and their ability to monitor health and
                  the advancements of medical robots and their delivery of
                  intricate operations. Global employment agency Randstad agree
                  that social care robots that can perform tasks such as
                  reminding patients to take medication and detecting illness,
                  could be the solution to filling the predicted staff shortages
                  in the future. However, they also highlight their design to
                  coexist, rather than becoming a sole care-giver. Bringing
                  robots into the workplace might not be a replacement for human
                  carers, but the support they are able to provide could lead to
                  improved quality of care due to the time they would save. As
                  with the healthcare industry, the financial sector is also
                  seeing a rise in robotics – more specifically, robotics
                  process automation (RPA). Currently in the research phase, RPA
                  will further provide the financial services industry with a
                  robotic workforce. The purpose of these robots is to enhance
                  productivity by reducing the need for human involvement in
                  dull, repetitive tasks. Additionally, with robotics not having
                  a need for rest, 24-hour trading is a nearing possibility. The
                  cyberattack risk With the increased responsibility of AI and
                  robotics in the workplace comes the increased risk of a
                  cyberattack. Cyber criminals, who either find an open window
                  in the cloud and hack into the pepper robots or sink the
                  financial markets, are certainly the most concerning risk. For
                  businesses facing this criminal threat in the future, the
                  consequences of a cyberattack could be devastating. Not only
                  are companies subject to direct financial losses, but they are
                  also liable for monetary penalties if their data protection
                  methods fail to comply with legislation. The online war on the
                  financial sector is only just taking shape, with weekly
                  reports of businesses being compromised by hackers. One threat
                  on the rise is ransomware, as highlighted in the global attack
                  that took place on May 12. In a report at the end of 2016,
                  cybersecurity firm Trend Micro predicted that although the
                  rapid growth of new ransomware families is growing, 2017 is
                  still likely to see a 25% increase. Raimund Genes, the firm’s
                  chief technology officer commented: “We foresee the [European
                  Union’s] General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) causing
                  extensive data management changes for companies around the
                  world, new attack methods threatening corporations, expanding
                  ransomware tactics impacting more devices and cyber-propaganda
                  swaying public opinion.” The US Federal Bureau of
                  Investigations (FBI) reported that the sophistication in
                  techniques of cyber gangs has already resulted in a year on
                  year (YoY) increase of 300% in cyber-attacks from 2015 to
                  2016; an average of 4,000 attacks per day. However, as
                  ransomware gets stronger, so does the ability to fight back.
                  In this month’s cyber-attack, whose targets ranged from the
                  UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and Germany’s rail network
                  to US courier service Fedex and Chinese universities, an IT
                  researcher was able to halt the attack before cyber-criminals
                  were paid any more than the £22,080 they had already received.
                  Having an automated detection process in place may have
                  prevented the attack in the first place. Could robotics be the
                  answer to preventing systems from being compromised and
                  vulnerable to cyber gangs? New developments of security
                  software can improve the chances of catching the 60-70% of
                  attacks missed by standard anti-virus systems. By automating
                  the malware detection process, many human hours can be spared
                  as the need for multiple checks is replaced. As it stands,
                  many companies rely on a strong response plan, but identifying
                  vulnerabilities before they are exposed, can significantly
                  reduce risks. The human alternative for this would be to find
                  a friendly hacker to find and fix problems before they arise.
